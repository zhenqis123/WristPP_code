## Overview

WristP² is a wrist-worn camera system that estimates **3D hand pose** and **per-vertex pressure** from a single wide-FOV RGB frame in real time.

**Planned release includes:**
- Model checkpoints (where permitted)
- Training & evaluation code
- Dataset access instructions (where permitted, part of)
- Demo scripts and visualization tools

---

## Release Plan (Tentative)

- [ ] Clean up and document core code
- [ ] Provide installation & environment setup
- [ ] Add inference demo
- [ ] Add evaluation scripts
- [ ] Add training code (if applicable)

If you would like early access for academic use, please contact the authors.
